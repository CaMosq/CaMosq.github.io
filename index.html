        <p class="content-text">
            Completing the Computer Science program, which I began in 2020, have provided me with four years of
            continuous learning, during which I built a robust foundation of technical knowledge, hands-on experience,
            and problem-solving skills that now prepare me to enter the workforce with confidence. The diverse projects
            and coursework have allowed me to demonstrate my strengths, refine my professional goals, and develop values
            that align with the fast-paced and ever-evolving nature of the computer science field. I have had the
            opportunity to work on a variety of challenges that required a mix of technical expertise, creativity, and
            collaboration, skills that are essential for success in this industry.
        </p>

                            technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
                            Enhancing the game involved thoughtful consideration of the user experience, with key
                            elements
                            designed to guide players through the game smoothly.

                            users.<br>

                            The enhancement of the inventory scene offers detailed information about the origin and
                            importance

                            developers and
                            users, I included gameplay instructions and technical details in a comprehensive README

                            ensuring that installation steps, gameplay, and key technical features were well documented.
                            Extensive comments were added throughout the codebase, making it easier for future

                            problem
                            using algorithmic
                            principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while
                            managing the
                            trade-offs involved in design choices. One of the major advancements in this project was the
                            transition
                            from a text-based game into a full-fledged interactive 2D game with a visually engaging user
                            interface.
                            By integrating Phaser 3 for rendering the game and Angular for managing the game’s frontend
                            architecture,
                            I demonstrated a clear ability to design solutions that solve complex user interaction
                            problems.
                            I implemented player movement, item collection, and used algorithmic principles to implement
                            player-object collisions that trigger different game actions and dynamic scene transitions,
                            ensuring the game mechanics remained smooth and intuitive.
                            <br>Additionally, I created the “GameStateService” to manage state between Angular and
                            Phaser.
                            For example, once an item is collected from a location, the game state records the event,
                            ensuring that if the player returns to the same location, the item cannot be collected
                            again.
                            This prevents item duplication and maintains a smooth, uninterrupted flow of gameplay.

                            in
                            computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value
                            and
                            accomplish industry-specific goals.
                            The game was refactored to separate the backend logic into modular components such as:
                            The game.py module that handles the core game logic. The game_classes.py module that handles
                            the definitions for game entities such as characters, items, and locations. The
                            game_objects.py module
                            that handles the Instantiations of in-game objects (e.g., items, locations). And
                            The game_api.py module that handles API endpoints for player actions, state saving, and
                            backend communication.
                            This separation of concerns made the codebase more maintainable and scalable.
                            On the frontend, I used HTML and CSS to build custom pop-ups and dialogues,
                            replacing Angular Material components with more tailored solutions for better control and a
                            cohesive game aesthetic.
                            I Integrated sound effects during player movements, item collection, and the final battle to
                            enhance the user
                            experience, making the game more immersive.

                            and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
                            Although the game is not heavily reliant on user input beyond the game mechanics, security
                            principles were still considered during development. The backend API was designed using
                            Flask,
                            which provided a secure and lightweight framework for handling game-related requests.
                            Additionally, the implementation of the “gameStateService” to handle the game state and data
                            within the application reduces the risk of unauthorized or unintended state changes.
                            This adheres to best practices in securing game logic, ensuring the integrity of the

                Originally, this artifact was a basic C++ application that read and printed data from a text file using
                a binary tree.
                The data contained in the text file was a list of university courses, each with a course number, course
                name,
                and a sublist of prerequisites. The core purpose of the application was to demonstrate the
                implementation of basic
                data structures and algorithms in a static, text-based environment.<br>
                After enhancements, the artifact has evolved into a robust Java-based algorithm testing application
                with a dynamic, interactive interface using JavaFX. The updated version allows users to test and
                visualize multiple algorithms such as Binary Search, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and
                others in real-time, providing a clear understanding of their performance and behavior with different
                data structures. I created the original version in 2022 for the CS 300 (Data structure and Algorithms)
                course and developed the enhanced version this year for the CS 499 Computer Science Capstone course.

                            visual
                            communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific
                            audiences and
                            contexts.
                            One of the key enhancements was the real-time algorithm visualization. I implemented visual
                            aids where
                            each element of a data structure is represented by a rectangle. The rectangles dynamically
                            change colors
                            to visually communicate the search process: starting with black, turning blue when visited,
                            and
                            highlighted in green when the target element is found. For sorting algorithms, I introduced
                            animations
                            that show the movement of each element as they are sorted, with rectangles shifting from
                            right to left
                            and turning blue once sorted. In the QuickSort algorithm, I highlighted the pivot element in
                            red on each
                            iteration. This visual representation significantly enhances the user experience by clearly
                            demonstrating how each algorithm operates.
                            <br>Below each algorithm, I added Vertical Boxes to display execution results such as
                            runtime and memory
                            usage, along with clear explanations of the algorithm’s behavior and time complexity. This
                            visual and
                            written communication ensures the application is technically sound and easy for users to
                            understand.
                            Additionally, I included extensive comments throughout the code to ensure that collaborators
                            and future
                            developers could easily navigate, understand, and extend the project.

                            managing the
                            trade-offs involved in design choices. Porting this artifact from C++ to Java with JavaFX
                            involved
                            critical design choices and adaptations. I faced the challenge of translating and
                            restructuring the code
                            to fit Java’s syntax and object-oriented structure while ensuring the application maintained
                            its
                            original functionality. This transition not only improved the user interface with JavaFX but
                            also
                            enhanced the performance of the algorithms.
                            I implemented multiple sorting and searching algorithms to test them across different data
                            structures,
                            allowing for a versatile execution environment. For example, sorting algorithms were applied
                            to course
                            objects alphabetically by course name, while searching algorithms targeted course objects by
                            course
                            number. To compare performance, I added both recursive and non-recursive searching
                            algorithms, allowing
                            users to test and evaluate their efficiency in real time. This enhancement demonstrates my
                            ability to
                            design computing solutions that address specific problems while managing trade-offs in
                            performance and
                            complexity.

                            accomplish industry-specific goals.
                            I refactored and modularized the code into distinct classes, separating the algorithms from
                            the data
                            structures, following industry-standard practices. This modular design makes the application

                            maintainable, and easier to debug. I created a GlobalUI class that implements the main
                            components of the
                            user interface, such as algorithm boxes, buttons, rectangles, containers, and labels. This

                            reusable and adaptable, meaning future developers can easily modify the UI by working within
                            this class
                            without affecting the core functionality of the program. By centralizing UI management in
                            the GlobalUI
                            class, the project becomes more flexible and resilient to changes, enabling easy updates or
                            redesigns to
                            the interface. This modular approach, along with the integration of performance metrics
                            (runtime and
                            memory usage), ensures that the application delivers tangible value while adhering to best
                            practices in
                            software development. It also provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as

                The Grocery Tracker is a web-based application designed to monitor and track the frequency of product
                purchases from a store, while also providing insights on sales trends. The original version of this
                artifact
                was created in C++ and focused on reading and analyzing data from text files generated by a store. This
                enhanced version, built with Java Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for the database, and Angular for
                the
                frontend, introduces a robust user interface, product management features, and visual representations of
                sales data, such as product frequency charts.
                <br>The artifact was initiated as part of a project for the CS210 course in 2023.

                I decided to include this artifact because it highlights my strengths in database management, backend
                development, and data visualization, all important components of software engineering.

                            to various users, such as store managers, sales teams, and business analysts. The dashboard

                            sales by category, and store locations with the highest purchases. I designed the database

                            contexts.
                            A key part of this project involved creating clear and effective ways for users to interact
                            with the
                            underlying data. I designed a “custom Angular form” that allowed users to add and manage
                            grocery items,
                            ensuring a smooth user experience. The form includes input validation, preventing users from
                            entering
                            incorrect data, and it connects seamlessly to the backend for product management.
                            Additionally, I provided users with a “dashboard” that visualizes key sales data, including
                            top-selling
                            products, sales by category, and store locations with the most purchases. I used charts and
                            graphs to
                            present this data, making it easy for users to understand sales trends and performance. Next
                            to each
                            chart, I added text boxes with chart summary and detailed explanation of the chart data. The
                            dashboard
                            automatically updates based on the data returned from SQL queries, demonstrating how
                            technical
                            information can be visually communicated to support decision-making. Clear instructions and
                            documentation were also provided in the README file to guide users and developers through
                            installing and
                            using the system.

                            principles and
                            computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the
                            trade-offs
                            involved in design choices.
                            The backend of the system, built using Spring Boot and MySQL, serves as the foundation of
                            the Grocery
                            Tracker project. One of the most significant challenges was designing the database schema to
                            track
                            products, categories, store locations, and sales. I designed a relational database that
                            includes
                            many-to-one relationships between products and categories, and products and store locations,
                            which
                            ensures efficient organization of the data.
                            <br>Advanced SQL queries were used to retrieve and manipulate data for reporting. For
                            example, I used
                            queries such as “SUM()” to calculate the total sales of each product, “COUNT()” to determine
                            the number
                            of times each product was purchased, “GROUP BY()” to group the sales by product name, and
                            “ORDER BY” to
                            sort the sales in descending order. These queries formed the basis of the Top Selling
                            Products chart on
                            the dashboard, where I Used “JOIN()” to join the sales and products tables to display the
                            product names
                            alongside the sales figures. This merging of tables allowed me to present meaningful
                            insights, helping
                            users quickly identify high-performing products. The database queries were optimized for
                            performance,
                            ensuring that the system could handle large datasets while maintaining responsiveness in the
                            user
                            interface.

                            computing
                            practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and
                            accomplish
                            industry-specific goals.
                            One of the most important innovations in the Grocery Tracker project was the creation of a
                            modular
                            backend architecture that separates concerns and makes the system scalable. By organizing
                            the backend
                            into distinct controllers like ProductController, CategoryController, SalesController, and
                            LocationController, I ensured that each component could be developed and maintained
                            independently,
                            making the system more efficient and easier to update as new features are added.
                            <br>The artifact frontend was built using Angular, which helped me create a dynamic and
                            interactive user
                            interface for users to track product sales visually. This choice demonstrated my ability to
                            use modern
                            front-end frameworks that meet industry standards for responsive and user-friendly
                            interfaces. I used
                            HTML and CSS, along with Angular material to create a sharedUI component to centralize all
                            UI elements,
                            such as buttons, tables, forms, and labels. This design allows future developers to modify
                            the UI
                            without disrupting the core functionality of the system. Additionally, I integrated modern
                            web
                            technologies and visualization tools such as the JavaScript library “Chart.js” with the
                            Angular wrapper
                            “ng2-charts” to create bar and pie type charts to visualize product sales data.

                            <span>-</span>Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture
                            and designs to
                            expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced
                            security of
                            data and resources.
                            Security was a critical focus during the development of this project. I implemented Spring
                            Security to
                            enforce user authentication and protect access to sensitive areas of the system. Users must
                            authenticate
                            before being able to view sales data or add new products to the tracker, ensuring only
                            authorized
                            personnel can modify or access the data.
                            <br>To further enhance security, I created a WebSecurityConfig class that handles CORS
                            (Cross-Origin
                            Resource Sharing) issues, ensuring that the frontend can securely communicate with the
                            backend while
                            mitigating risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). This configuration also ensures that
                            unauthorized
                            requests from untrusted origins are blocked.
                            Additionally, parameterized SQL queries were employed throughout the project to protect
                            against SQL
                            injection attacks. By using parameterized queries, user inputs are safely handled and passed
                            to the
                            database, preventing malicious actors from injecting harmful SQL code into the system.
                            <br>These security enhancements demonstrate a proactive approach to safeguarding the
                            application from
                            potential exploits, ensuring that user data and business information remain secure. The use
                            of
                            authentication, CORS handling, and query protection reflects industry best practices for
                            building
                            secure and reliable applications.
